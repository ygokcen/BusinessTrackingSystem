## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Backend Setup (.NET)

#### Prerequisites:
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- SQL Server (or the target database engine)

#### Steps:

```bash
cd BusinessTrackingSystem/BusinessTrackingSystem

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Apply Entity Framework migrations
dotnet ef database update

# Run the backend server
dotnet run
````

Ensure that `appsettings.json` contains a valid connection string under `"ProjectConnection"`.

### 2. Frontend Setup (React)

#### Prerequisites:

* Node.js (v18+ recommended)
* npm or yarn

#### Steps:

```bash
cd BusinessTrackingSystem/BusinessTrackingSystem/Frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

npm start
```

Frontend connects to the backend via environment-based API endpoints. Ensure appropriate `.env` configuration if required.
